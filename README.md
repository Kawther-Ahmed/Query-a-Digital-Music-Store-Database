# Query-a-Digital-Music-Store-Database
The repository contains a dataset called "chinook-db" that represents a digital music store's database schema. It also includes a file named "Queries1.txt" which contains SQL queries written to retrieve specific information from the database. Additionally, there is a "Visualization1.pdf" file that showcases the results and visualizations generated from the queries. This project provides hands-on practice and examples of SQL queries in the context of a digital music store database, allowing users to explore and analyze the data effectively.
